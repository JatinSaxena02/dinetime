# dinetime
## This app helps you to book table in your favorite restaurants.

# 📌 Project Overview

The Dinner Table Booking App is a mobile application designed to help users easily search, discover, and reserve tables at their favorite restaurants. Instead of manually calling or visiting restaurants to check availability, users can conveniently browse nearby dining options and book a table in just a few taps.
The app leverages Firebase as the backend for authentication, data storage, and real-time updates. Restaurants are stored in Firestore, and users can perform search queries (with filters) to quickly find the right place.
